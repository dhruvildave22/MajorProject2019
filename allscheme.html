              <p class="card-text text-justify" style=" max-height:280px; overflow:auto;" >In 1993, the Technology Development Missions (TDM) started at all the IITs and IISc with the objective of a concerted national effort towards technology development with direct involvement and participation of industries. Several mission projects, with well-defined goals, milestones and deliverables were identified in areas of national importance. Two or more academic institutions and industries collaborated in most of the mission projects. The funding to these mission areas was as follows:

Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) funded these projects to the tune of Rs. 50.00 crores.

Industry participants contributed about Rs. 9.00 crores in addition to support in terms of equipment, components, manpower and hardware etc. worth Rs. 15.00 crores.

The most important aspect of this mission was a significant effort on the part of the Government in encouraging industry-institute interaction as well as assisting industry in developing the latest technology. This was first time that mission oriented programs were successfully taken jointly with industry.The TDM-I was successful and highly appreciated in the National Steering Committee meeting of the Planning Commission held on August 06, 1999 at New Delhi. TDM-I resulted in development and transfer of several technologies to Industry</p>

The partners in setting up the IllTs would be the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Governments of the respective States where each lllT will be established, and the industry.

A major objective in establishing IllTs is to set up a model of education which can produce best-in-class human resources in IT and harnessing the multidimensional facets of IT in various domains. While the number of students produced by these IIITs would be small, the impact they create would be great.</p>

It will foster the development of new values through redesigned curricula, textbooks, the training and orientation of teachers, decision-makers and administrators, and the active involvement of educational institutions. This will be an act of faith and social engineering…” NPE, 1986

The National Policy on Education, 1986 recognised that the empowerment of women is possibly the most critical pre-condition for the participation of girls and women in the educational process. The Mahila Samakhya programme was launched in 1988 to pursue the objectives of the National Policy on Education, 1986. It recognised that education can be an effective tool for women’s empowerment,</p>

The Scheme of Inclusive Education for Disabled at Secondary Stage (IEDSS) has been launched from the year 2009-10. This Scheme replaces the earlier scheme of Integrated Education for Disabled Children (IEDC) and provides assistance for the inclusive education of the disabled children in classes IX-XII. This scheme now subsumed under Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) from 2013. The States/UTs are also in the process of subsuming under RMSA as RMSA subsumed Scheme.
The scheme covers all children studying at the secondary stage in Government, local body and Government-aided schools, with one or more disabilities as defined under the Persons with Disabilities Act (1995) and the National Trust Act (1999) in the class IX to XII, namely blindness, low vision, leprosy cured, hearing impairment, locomotory disabilities, mental retardation, mental illness, autism, and cerebral palsy and may eventually cover speech impairment, learning disabilities, etc. Girls with the disabilities receive special focus to help them gain access to secondary schools, as also to information and guidance for developing their potential. Setting up of Model inclusive schools in every State is envisaged under the scheme.

This is a new Centrally Sponsored Scheme launched in 2008-09 and is being implemented from 2009-10 to set up a 100-bedded Girls’ Hostel in each of 3479 Educationally Backward Blocks (EBBs) in the country. The Scheme has replaced the earlier NGO driven Scheme for construction and running of Girls’ Hostels for Students of Secondary and Higher Secondary Schools, under which assistance was provided to voluntary organisations for running Girls’ Hostels.

The main objective of the Scheme is to retain the girl child in secondary school so that girl students are not denied the opportunity to continue their study due to distance to school, parents’ financial affordability and other connected societal factors. Another objective of the Scheme is to make Secondary and Senior Secondary education accessible to a larger number of girl students.

While setting up the new State Resource Centres, priority is to be given to States that do not have any SRC but where literacy levels, as per 2001 census, is below the national average. States with more than 20 districts would be facilitated to set up one additional State Resource Centres, while States with more than 30 districts would be eligible for a total of 3 State resource Centres.

                                                                  The Central Government entrusted the National Council for Educational Research & Training (NCERT) to evaluate the Teacher Education Scheme. The NCERT submitted its Report in August, 2009. The Report contains several recommendations for revising the Scheme. The Ministry is in the process of revising the Scheme.
